# Test suite

This folder contains a rudimentary test suite for CRAFT. It mainly tests to make
sure the instrumentation doesn't crash on a range of executables, but it also
does contain some correctness testing for both the instrumentation and the
search routine.

To run the testsuite, just execute the `run_tests.sh` script, or if you want to
skip the crash tests, you could run `search_tests.sh` directly.
